# Pneumonia Detection Using Transfer Learning

* Pneumonia is an infectious and fatal respiratory disease caused by bacteria, fungi, or a virus that infects human lung air sacs with a load full of fluid or pus.

* Chest x-rays are the common method used to diagnose pneumonia and it takes a medical expert to assess the result of the x-ray. The troublesome method of detecting pneumonia leads to loss of life due to improper diagnosis and treatment.

* With the emerging computing power, the development of an automatic pneumonia detection and disease treatment system is now possible, especially if the patient is in a remote area and medical services are limited.

* In this Web application, we used Transfer Learning model [**VGG16**](https://keras.io/api/applications/vgg/) for prediction

* This Web application is created and deployed in [**Streamlit**](https://streamlit.io/)
